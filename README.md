# Signup Form

## Description

This repository contains a simple signup form implemented using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The signup form allows users to input their username, email, and password, and upon submission, it performs basic client-side validation.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The form is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Client-Side Validation:** JavaScript is used to validate the form inputs before submission. It checks whether all fields are filled and displays an error message if any field is empty.
- **Error Handling:** Error messages are displayed dynamically below the form when validation fails, providing feedback to the user.
- **Submission Handling:** Upon successful validation, the form data (username, email, password) is logged to the console. This can be further extended to handle form submission to a server.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure and markup of the signup form.
- **CSS:** Styling for the form and its elements to enhance visual appeal and usability.
- **JavaScript:** Client-side scripting for form validation and handling form submission.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and interact with the signup form.
3. Optionally, customize the form styling or validation logic to suit your requirements.
